## Join the Search & Help Design a Citizen Science Project!

------

To get started, you'll need an [account on Ecosounds](https://www.ecosounds.org/my_account/sign_up),
and then [let me know you'd like to participate in the Eastern Bristlebird project](https://www.ecosounds.org/contact_us).

If you have registered, obtained access to the project and been provided a Google spreadsheet, then you are ready to start searching! 


## Starting Your Sound Search!

**To start searching for animal vocalisations, like the sweet serenades of this Eastern Bristlebird, in 10 easy steps!**


{% include figure.html src="./media/ebb_350x257.jpg" caption="Eastern Bristlebird (Jessie Cappadonna)" medium="true" %}

1. **Open** Chrome web browser and log into [www.ecosounds.org](https://www.ecosounds.org/).
2. **View** your google spreadsheet to see that you have audio from multiple locations and times of day. 
3. **Inform** me of the order you will review links using the _Notes for Jess_ tab of your spreadsheet. 
   This is up to you, and will help me understand preferences for future designs.
4. **Play** environmental recordings by clicking a link from the _Hyperlink_ column of your spreadsheet if Chrome is your default web browser. 
    Otherwise, copy a link from the _Original links_ column and paste it into the web address bar of a Chrome tab and press enter.
    The play button is highlighted by the blue oval in Figure 1a.
5. **Time** how long it takes you to work through 10 minutes of audio recordings following the stop time listed in your spreadsheet. 
6. **Search** each of the ten minute segments using one of the following strategies, which all include drawing boxes around 
   calls (a.k.a. [annotating](#annotation-hints)) and labeling (a.k.a. [tagging](#tagging-tips)) calls within the boxes:
	- **Indicate Sounds**: When finding a good example of a particular sound that you aren't able to identify, just annotate and tag 
	  the call so that it can be located and identified by others easily. You could also add it to 
	  the [Solving Stumper Sounds](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bi8UXihbrASNy0SP2KsAYPIqWiSPzoE2ApDruRhoXiE/edit?usp=sharing) page.
	- **Identify Sounds**:  If you know anything about the sounds you hear or see, annotate and tag the sounds accordingly. 
	  Check out example [Eastern Bristlebird songs](#eastern-bristlebirds-are-singing!) too!
	- **Bristlebird Blitz:**: If you are most keen to be the first to find Eastern bristlebirds in environmental recordings, you could just focus on looking for them!
	- **Perfect Pitch:** If you are interested in considering a particular feature of the calls to potentially make a novel 
	  discovery, pitch the idea to me along with the tags you would need to use to complete the task, and I will see what I can do!
7. **Draw** boxes around calls by clicking and dragging with your mouse on the spectrogram to create a box around the call, 
   which can be re-sized or deleted as needed.
8. **Label** a box when it is selected (as indicated by the box being yellow instead of green (Figure 1b)). 
   **Please note** every annotation must be given a tag so we can find the sound later! 
   See [Tagging Tips](#tagging-tips) for details, though you will primarily be using three types of tags:
	- ___species___: You can tag a call by species common names (if can't find it [let us know](https://www.ecosounds.org/contact_us)).
	- '**unsure**': If you think you know what made a call but are not fairly certain, you can add a species tag, and also with an unsure tag. 
	  You can search for example calls using our acoustic [Library]( https://www.ecosounds.org/library) (via Chrome) or 
	  by searching [Xeno-Canto](http://www.xeno-canto.org/), an online global avian acoustics database. 
	- '**unknown**': when you have no idea who or what made a particular sound.
9. **Record** your findings by filling out columns H through O on the _Audio Segments_ tab of your spreadsheet. 
10. **Help** others with identification of sounds if you have particular expertise. You can see what others are marking 
    as unsure or unknown in the [Solving Stumper Sounds](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bi8UXihbrASNy0SP2KsAYPIqWiSPzoE2ApDruRhoXiE/edit?usp=sharing) document, 
    which will be added to and changed regularly.

**Figure 1.** a) The blue circle is highlighting a play button, and the red circle is highlighting an button that give you the option to "auto play" recordings 30 seconds at a time. 
b) Numerous calls are annotated (green boxes) and tagged, and the call with the yellow annotation is actively being tagged. 

## Eastern Bristlebirds are Singing!

Below are the most common call types found when looking through several days of acoustic data collected from captive birds at Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary. 

*Note* that there is a lot of variation in the calls and there may be more than currently listed there so if in question annotate and tag it!

## Annotation Hints

Here are a few frequently asked questions and pointers about creating annotations: 

**What is considered a "call"?**

For the purposes of this project, a "call" is defined as a single discrete vocalisation separated by 2 or more seconds until the next vocalisation by the same individual. 
Calls from multiple individuals may be overlap - it can be difficult to annotate these calls, don't worry if you skip calls that overlap. 

**How do I delete an annotation?**

Annotations created by mistake can be deleted by clicking the small black "X" in the top left hand corner of the annotation. 
In cases where the annotation box is small, you may need to expand it by clicking and dragging, in order to see the "X" and delete the annotation. 

**Can I create annotations and not bother tagging them?**

Please add at least one tag to every annotation you create! 
We appreciate and need your work, and without a tag we don't know what you're annotating, so we will struggle to find it in the future.
If you suspect you know the species but aren't certain, add the specific species tag, as well as the "unsure" tag. 
If you don't know the species at all tag the annotation with "unknown" (see [Tagging Tips](#tagging-tips) for ways to speed up the process!)

## Tagging Tips
**What kind of tags already exist on Ecosounds?**

The tag list is not exhaustive, though we do have the most common tags:

- Animal common names (most frequently used)
- Animal scientific names
- Animal age & sex (e.g. _juvenile_, _male_, _female_)
- Animal behaviour descriptors (e.g. _conflict_, _response_, _alarm_, _advertisement_, _contact_)
- Tags for the shapes a call reminds you of are available (e.g. calls that look like 
  [flower](https://www.ecosounds.org/library?tagsPartial=flower-shaped&reference=reference&page=1&items=10) or 
  [interted-y](https://www.ecosounds.org/library?tagsPartial=inverted-y&reference=reference&page=1&items=10) shapes)
- _unsure_ is applied when adding a species tag you aren't sure about
- Tags for what the sound reminds you of are also available
- _unknown_ tag is used when the species of a vocalisation is completely unfamiliar


**What if there is not tag for what I find or for my idea?** 

[Send us a link](https://www.ecosounds.org/contact_us) to the annotation and your suggested tag addition! 
We will then let you know if something similar exists or if we can add your tag. 
Some species are missing from the database, so please drop us a line if you can't find a tag!

**What should I do if animals are calling at the same time?**

Usually, only single calls are annotated. If you find something amazing, however, and there happen multiple animals calling at the same time, 
you can use the _overlap_ tag to let researchers know this annotation is interesting but not a good representative call for a species. 

**Do I need to save my annotations and tags before I got to the next 30 seconds?**

Annotations and tags are saved automatically as you make them, so just click on the next arrow a the bottom of the spectrogram. 

**I am sick of typing the same tag names over and over! Is there a faster way?**

Actually YES, and it will save you heaps of time with some practice! 
Just type the string of tags you would like to add to a specific annotation into a text file, 
separating each tag with a comma (no spaces around the comma!), and remember that comma at the end. 
Then copy the entire tag string and paste it into the tag line while the annotation is highlighted.

*Example tag string:* Eastern Bristlebird,advertisement,male,

**When tagging, I noticed many tags come up that are followed by numbers. Why?**

Tags with numbers are tags from old projects. Please only use tags that do not have numbers to ensure you are using the most current tags.

**When adding tags, I noticed there is a "Reference" tick box. What is that for?**

Don't worry about the reference tick boxes, but essentially, the box is ticked by project moderators to select particularly good examples for each animal vocalisation. 
It is difficult for each volunteer to know what call types have already been ticked, so just leave that to me!

## Don't be a stranger!

**If you have questions, feedback, or ideas for improvements drop me a line**!

In terms of my research, I am _REALLY_ interest knowing: 

1. What species and habitats you are interested in learning about and hearing?
2. Species you would be interested in learning more about.
2. What ideas do you have for other information to include on the Ecosounds website?
3. Do you have any different ideas on how to display acoustic recordings?
4. Are you interested in being part of citizen science research about acoustics?

You can contact me, Jessie Cappadonna via the [contact us page](https://www.ecosounds.org/contact_us),
