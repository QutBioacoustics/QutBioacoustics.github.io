By listening to the sounds of animals and habitats we can learn many things, such as

-   The number of species in an area

-   How many individuals of a species are in an area

-   Where secretive, camouflaged, and/or threatened species live

-   Vocalisation and movement behaviours of species

-   Shifts in sounds of an environment (soundscape) after an environmental disturbance

-   Patterns in the sounds of an environment (soundscape) over time, such as days, months, years, or seasons

## 1) About Acoustics


Nature is filled with complex and variable mosaics of sound that are difficult to study. The air often rings with bird songs as the sun rises, and frog and bat calls may fill the night, accompanied with a background hum of a cricket chorus. When fine-tuning your ear, you might notice that a single bird has a number of calls, but even a single call can vary each time it is made. This fine-scale variation may provide important information to animal listeners, but it often eludes human ears and understanding. Some bird species can mimic other species, which can trick both humans and other animals, particular when the caller cannot be seen. Much like people, many animal species also have regional differences in the ways they communicate.

### 1.1) Recognising sounds

Computer recognition software can now automatically recognise patterns effectively in human speech; however, such software works well because of the way humans speak, and with recordings made from a short distance with minimal background noise. In nature, however, animal sounds are generated through a number of ways, and animals will be at varied distances from audio recorders, which effects the volume. volume. Additionally, animal sounds can be drowned out by weather events (such as rain, wind, or thunder) or by human or mechanical sounds (such as motorcycles, airplanes, or other machines). To develop recognition software for even a single call of a species from natural recordings requires an ample supply of time, patience, and money, and such software usually has limited accuracy.

### 1.2) Visualising sounds

Luckily, we are able to decipher most sounds of nature from acoustic recordings with our ears better than computer recognition software, especially when able to simultaneously visualise sound. Sound is essentially vibrations through air, which are heard when they reach our ears. These vibrations can be graphed as frequency over time to create visualisations of sound, known as spectrograms (Figure 1 & 2). In grey-scale spectrograms, sounds will be seen as darker regions, with nearer or louder calls being darker than calls that are softer or farther away (Figure 1).

**Figure 1. This is an example of a grey-scale spectrogram, which is a visual representation of sound as frequently in kilohertz (kHz; y-axis) over time as seconds (30 seconds visible above; x-axis). Dark shapes represent sound events such as bird calls. Variation in the darkness of shapes indicates differences in loudness, which is in part due to distance of calls in relation to the acoustic monitor.**

Mathematical formulas or algorithms known as acoustic indices can produce statistics that summarise sound vibration, or acoustic energy, over time. These summary statistics can then be graphed, as false-colour spectrograms, to view frequency patterns in time over a much larger time scale, such as days, months, or years (Figure 2). Our lab is working on different research projects where people use different combinations of 14 such indices to highlight target groups of animals, specific species, or patterns. One algorithm might, for example, highlight sound frequencies associated with rain, while another may help researchers to see shifts in sound of an environment over a year.


<img src="./media/image2.png"   width="100%" />

**Figure 2. This is an example of a false-colour spectrogram, which graphs sound frequency in kHz (y-axis) over time that is compressed into approximately 30 hours above (x-axis). This graph combines three different indices to display colours. In this case, green frequency ranges represent bird calls during the daylight hours, whereas pink and purple frequency ranges represent crickets calling during night hours.**

These coarse-scale graphs are difficult to use to find specific animals, so members of our lab are also currently developing tools that enable people to zoom in on particular regions of the graphs for closer inspection. We can all look through acoustic data using the tools on the Ecosounds.org website to make ecological discoveries!




## 2) About Ecosounds.org

The Ecosounds.org website has been developed by the Ecosounds research lab in the QUT School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The lab is largely focused on computer science research to develop innovative ways to sample, analyse, and visualise complex long-duration sound recordings from a wide variety of habitats. The website is one result of this research, and today its primary purpose is to provide collaborating ecologists with tools to view and assess acoustic data. As new methods are created, these new tools are integrated as time and funding allows. Be sure to revisit the website from time to time to find out what new tools have been added.

More citizen science projects are likely to be added to the site in the future too so keep in touch!


## 4) Exploring Projects

Before we jump into reviewing acoustic recordings, let me show you how to navigate the website, as well as how the website tools work! As discussed above, once you have registered, you will be given access to the Oxley Creek recordings (Figure 6). These project recordings are for you to have a play around with the website, and have a go at drawing boxes around sounds you see and hear in spectrograms (we call this *annotating*), as well as how to label (also known as to *tag*) boxes you create with information about the sound they contain.

More details about how to do all of this is given below, but once you have a feel for using the site, let us know if you are game to make discoveries from acoustic data by getting involved with an active project! One project you are welcome to **_request access_** to **_Bristlebird Bioacoustics Bonanza_** (Figure 8)! Find out more about this exciting project in Section 5, but the website functionality descriptions below are based on this project as the exemplar citizen science project we expect most folks to be involved with.

In general, the Ecosound.org website displays information on both a project and site level. Most projects involve deployment of multiple acoustic monitors, and a site refers to the location an individual monitor is deployed. In the case of the **_Bristlebird Bioacoustics Bonanza_** project, one acoustic monitor was placed at the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary to record and learn the calls of the Eastern Bristlebirds. Twelve additional monitors were placed in three regions where wild bristlebirds were suspected to be, with four monitors, or sites, being in each region (Figure 9). 

<img src="./media/image9.png"  width="100%"/>

**Figure 9. A schematic of the Bristlebird Bioacoustics Bonanza project.**

In this case, the Eastern Bristlebird Recovery Team is targeting a small area in each region based on where Penny the detector dog indicated smelling bristlebird. Given the closeness of monitors within a region, there is a reasonable chance that if a bristlebird is heard in one monitor, the same call might be hear in another recording as well. This might help researchers figure out what direction the bird was headed. On the website you have the option of exploring “Details” or to “Visualise” information at both the project level and site level.


### 4.1) Navigating “Details” and “Visualise” Pages

Clicking on “Details” or “Visualise” both reveal important information about projects and sites within a project. When on the page listing projects you have access to you can either click on a project title or “Details” icon for an overview of the project for a project description, as well as a map and hyperlinked list of all project sites, as well as their own “Details” and “Visualise” pages (Figure 8 & 10). 

<img src="./media/image10.png"   width="100%" />

**Figure 10. A screenshot of the Bristlebird Bioacoustics Bonanza project “Details” page.**

If you opt to click the “Visualise” icon rather than the “Details” icon on the page listing projects, you will be taken to a page that provides a visual overview of dates and times that recordings were collected for all sites within the project (Figure 11a). When you click on a section of the data, that site will expand in view, and you can now zoom in to have a more refined view of the data (Figure 11b), and if a false-colour spectrogram has been generated for the site, this is visible at the bottom when the section above is clicked on a section of recorded data (Figure 11c).

<img src="./media/image11.png"   width="100%" />

**Figure 11. A screenshot of the visualisation page for the Bristlebird Bioacoustics Bonanza project, demonstrating the zooming functionality to review days and time data was recorded, as well as viewing the false-colour spectrogram when available for a particular site.**

Zooming is a bit tricky to get the hang of at first, but with a bit of experimenting, you will get the hang of it! Similarly to how Google Maps can zoom to show different amounts of a map, you can zoom in and out to see different amounts of acoustic recordings - use the mouse wheel to zoom or pinch your mousepad or screen. You can shift the dates you're looking at by dragging your mouse or finger across the touchpad. If you click the “Go to” link, you will be taken to the 30 seconds of data at that location, and zooming helps get to the specific segment of time you may want.


## 5) Exploring Sites of a Project

Site level pages can be easily accessed by clicking on the “Details” page for the project of interest and a list of sites for the project will be displayed (Figure 10). As with each project, there are “Detail” and “Visualise” pages for each site (Figures 12 & 13), but at the site level you can also “Play” acoustic recordings. 


A site “Details” page provides an overview of site information, including a list of recent activity in relation to drawing boxes around sounds and labelling the boxes (see “Recent Annotations”) on that site’s acoustic data (Figure 12). 

<img src="./media/image12.png"   width="100%" />

**Figure 12. A screenshot of an example “Details” page of a site. Note that “Recent Annotations” refers to the most recent boxes drawn and associated labels.**

The site “Visualise” pages work much like the project visualise pages (see Section 4 for navigation tips), with the top bar having navigation capabilities (e.g. drag and zoom), and the bottom bar displaying the acoustic data as a false-colour spectrogram for some sites (Figure 13). To listen to the sound and see greyscale spectrograms of a site’s acoustics data, click on the “Play” icon (Figure 13). 

<img src="./media/image13.png"   width="100%"/>

**Figure 13. A screenshot of two site “Visualise” pages to demonstrate page appearance differences, with (a) the top site “Visualise” page being a zoomed out view with no false-colour spectrogram being generated and (b) the bottom site “Visualise” page being zoomed in and including a false colour spectrogram.**

This is where you can also identify sounds for research! In order to identify a specific sound in the system, you find a sound of interest, draw a box around it, and then label the box with information about the sound.


### 5.1) How to Draw and Label a Perfect Box!

Here are some pointers to help you draw the most useful box:

#### 5.1.1) Requirements & Hints

1.  If the audio is playing, and you recognise a sound you would like to label, it might be easiest to **_stop the recording_** from playing so you have enough time. You can do this by clicking the “Pause/Play” icon (see blue circle; Figure 14a) or the “Autoplay” icon (see red circle; Figure 14a).

2.  Click and drag (this is easiest when using a mouse) on the spectrogram **_to draw a box_** around only one sound event at a time, noting the box may only capture a particular segment or syllable of a call if there is a clean break of 2 or more seconds between syllables (Figure 14b).

3.  **_Draw the box tightly_** around the entire height and width of the sound, ensuring there is minimal empty space around the call/acoustic event, and note that when the box is highlighted, the “Tag” field below the spectrogram is enabled so you can then label the box you have highlighted (Figure 14b).

4.  If you know what is making the sound you have boxed, start **_typing the name in the “Tag” field_** when the box you have drawn is highlighted (Figure 14b). You can add one, two, or more labels.

5.  If you are working on a project that requires labelling of multiple species, and **_you find something unknown, unexpected, or bizarre_**, please label it “unknown” so that the sound can be found and reviewed by someone else on the team.

6.  If you add one or labels, but are not sure if those labels are correct, you can also add the “unsure” label.

7.  **_Delete any unlabelled boxes_** drawn by clicking on the small black "X" in the top left-hand corner of the box.

8.  Once you have drawn a box and labelled any calls you want to in the visible 30 seconds of acoustic recording, you can **_click the forward button to progress_** to the next 30 seconds.

#### 5.1.2) More Information is Better (optional labels)! 

1.  You are also welcome to **label a sound of interest that is overlapping
2.  -** with another sound, but please include an "overlap" label for such a box (Figure 14b).

2.  Feel free to **_add labels that describe additional information_** you know, such as if the call was made in "response" to another animal, during a "conflict" or by a "male", "female", or "juvenile". Feel free to suggest a new label if you can’t find what you would like! We might already have an equivalent label we can share with you too.

3.  When you see a call, does the shape look like anything to you? **_Now is your chance to name a call!_** We need your ideas for “looks-like” labels for calls, so we can distinguish between each call type. Eastern Bristlebirds, for example, have over 6 different call shapes (e.g. “check mark” or “flower-shaped”). The easier it is to describe and differentiate calls, the more information we can learn together!

**_I welcome all feedback no matter how big or small on these instructions and you experience using the website._**

Things we are also interested to know include:

1) Species you would be interested in learning more about through acoustics.

2) What ideas do you have for other information to include on Ecosounds.org about a study or species?

3) Do you have any different ideas on how to display the sound recordings?

4) Are you interested in being part of citizen science research about acoustics?
