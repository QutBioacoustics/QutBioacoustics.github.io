## Name change

Our research group's name changed from _Microsoft QUT eResearch Sensors_ group to
the _QUT Ecoacoustics Research Group_.

## Website change

The old website previously hosted at <http://sensor.mquter.qut.edu.au> was revamped,
recreated, and redesigned. 

The new website is hosted at <https://www.ecosounds.org> and runs software named
_The Acoustic Workbench_.

## Old software
 
We have an archived, non functional, copy of the code privately hosted at 
<https://github.com/QutBioacoustics/old-mquter-general>. The code was proprietary 
and probably will not be shared.

We have some resources from the old site still available, like screenshots of
the software. If you need these resources, please contact us.

Since then, our new website software has been open sourced. See [our GitHub 
organization](https://github.com/QutBioacoustics) to see the code.

## Data from sensor.mquter.qut.edu.au

All data, including:

- Audio recordings, sites, and projects
- Audio annotations and taggings
- User accounts
- and other data

were imported into the new _Acoustic Workbench_ application which is now hosted 
at <https://www.ecosounds.org>.

## Publications

Any pubications that references <http://sensor.mquter.qut.edu.au> have hopefully 
been redirected to this page so that the hyperlinks remain useful.

You can find a list of all of our publications on our 
[publications page](http://research.ecosounds.org/publications/publications.html)
