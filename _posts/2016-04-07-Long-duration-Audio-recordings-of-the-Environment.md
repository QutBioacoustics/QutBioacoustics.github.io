Our lead researcher, Michael Towsey, recently visited some ecoacoustics research labs in Europe and the USA. 
Michael's slide deck evolved into a great summary of our current research. It discusses our current visualization
techniques and includes content from many of our fantastic collaborators. 

We decided instead of archiving the slide deck, to publish it to our website so that everyone who missed the 
talk could get the content for themselves.

You can access the webpage here:  [Long-duration Audio-recordings of the Environment: Visualisation & Analysis](/research/EADM-Towsey/Long-Duration-Audio-Recordings-of-the-environment.html).

It was adapted from a 40 minute presentation so you can expect a hearty read. If you'd like any more information
on the slides or content you can contact our research group by going to the
[contact us page](https://www.ecosounds.org/contact_us).
