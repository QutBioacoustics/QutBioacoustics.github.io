Two weeks ago our lab helped organise the [2018 Ecoacoustics Congress](https://ecoacousticscongress.org/).
We had a great time at the congress, learnt a lot, and met a whole bunch of
interesting people! This post will point out some of the resources from the congress
that we're making available.

## Michael's Keynote

Michael Towsey delivered his keynote that asked the question: "Has Ecoacoustics
come of age?". Michael has kindly published an annotated version of his slides
from the congress here: [TODO]

## Zooming Spectrograms

At the congress we demonstrated the new Zooming False-Color Spectrogram interface
that is now available on [Ecosounds](https://www.ecosounds.org). This interface is
an interactive, _Google Maps_ style, visualisation of audio data that allows a
user to see the structure and content of their audio data from scales of minutes,
zooming out continuously, all the way though to weeks of data.
You can find out more about the method used for creating these images [TODO].

This feature is baked into Ecosounds and anyone hosting their data sets with us
will get this visualisation generated automatically. We've generated the visualisation
for roughly 40% of the data on Ecosounds and over the coming months we expect to
finish the generation for the rest of the data.

You can see if your data has the visualisation by clicking on the _Explore Audio_
link on the project or site details pages on Ecosounds.

## AnalysisPrograms.exe Workshop

At the congress we ran a workshop that introduced our AnalysisPrograms.exe tool
and taught participants how to use it. The practical component covered how to 
download, set up, and run AP.exe and also covered generating acoustic indices and
False-Color spectrograms. The workshop went well: we got great questions, 
great feedback, a few bug-reports, and we were very happy with the turnout.

The practical component of the workshop has been published online; if you missed
the congress or you wanted to try the practical again you can find it here:

If you have any bug reports or feature requests for AnalysisPrograms.exe please
