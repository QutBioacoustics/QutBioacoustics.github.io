title: Citizen Science is for the Birds

Did you know that sharing your bird sightings contributes invaluably to science,
and that doing so makes you a citizen scientist? For decades, bird enthusiasts across
Australia and around the world have enjoyed keeping track what birds they’ve seen
on excursions. Before internet and mobile devices, many naturalists, including
Charles Darwin, contributed observations to museums and universities for
researchers to study. These nature enthusiasts of the past would likely be
considered citizen scientists today. In our time, we can all share our
observations with each other to facilitate finding that “must-see” bird,
as well as to easily and substantially contribute to science.

As an eBird contributor and bona fide citizen scientist, you may be
interested in knowing that the Australian Academy of Science supported
the first [Australian Citizen Science Conference](http://www.citizenscience.org.au/) in July 2015 in Canberra.
The focus of the conference was on “Maximising the Capacity of Citizen
Science for Science and Society.” A roaring success, Australia’s Chief
Scientist Ian Chubb set the energetic tone of the conference with the
announcement of the [Occasional Paper: Building Australia Through Citizen Science](http://www.chiefscientist.gov.au/2015/07/occasional-paper-building-australia-through-citizen-science/).

Birds were very well represented throughout the conference.
Rick Bonney from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, for example, gave a
very informative and entertaining history of his citizen science career
with the lab. BirdLife Australia representatives discussed their citizen
science initiatives and how avian observations help them understand changes
in populations from where species are found. I presented a poster and
co-led a workshop on my current research which aims to understand how
citizen scientists can help search for the Eastern Bristlebird from acoustic
recordings. The [Gang-Gang Survey Project](http://canberrabirds.org.au/observing-birds/gang-gang-survey/) was also well represented at this
Canberra conference. As a birder, myself, I couldn’t leave Canberra
without spotting my first Gang-gang Cockatoo.

Key themes of the conference included improving design, impact, outcomes,
and evaluation of citizen science, as well as collection, validation, analysis,
management, and sharing of citizen science data. The conference highlighted the
diversity of important citizen science projects already contributing to science
in Australia, whether making astronomy observation from your home computer or
recording observations of nature while outdoors (e.g. water quality monitoring
or plant and animal observations). As a part of the conference the [Australian
Citizen Science Association (ACSA)](http://www.citizenscience.org.au/) also held their first Annual General Meeting,
became incorporated, and elected their first management committee.

Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you would like to know more about
citizen science, the ACSA, or my acoustics research.
