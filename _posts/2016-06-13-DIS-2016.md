The biennial ACM SIGCHI conference, #DIS2016, Designing Interactive Systems was themed "fuse".
This theme highlights fusing boundaries in all areas and exploring
design possibilities of all form. The conference was held at QUT Garden Points Campus in Brisbane.
In the 3 day conference, designs of all forms were discussed, highlighting design
as a process as well as design as a product, and how it matters as we reimagine new designs in a
variety of context for the future. 

In specific to environmental conservation and monitoring,
Tshering submitted a provocative
work in progress paper ["_Challenges in Designing Visual Analytics for
Environmental Acoustic Monitoring_"](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2909402)
and also presented a poster on this topic.

Also from our lab, Jessie Cappadonna, presented a poster on her discussion paper ["_Calls from the wild: Engaging citizen scientists with animal sounds_"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2908805.2909413). Jess and her co-authors suggest that perhaps future citizen science including acoustics would benefit from implementation of a co-designed approach, combining knowledge of expert citizen scientist birders reliant on acoustics outdoors, citizen scientists engaged with online projects (e.g. [DigiVol](http://australianmuseum.net.au/digivol)), computer scientists, and computer scientists. If you would like more information about Jess' research feel free to contact her as listed on her [profile](http://research.ecosounds.org/people/people.html).
