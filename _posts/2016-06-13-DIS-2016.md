The biennial ACM SIGCHI conference Designing Interactive Systems,DIS2016, was themed "fuse". The theme for this year highlights fusing boundaries in all areas and exploring 
design possiblities of all form. The conference was held at QUT Garden Points Campus in Brisbane. In the 3 days conference, designs of all forms were discussed, highlighting design
as a process as well as design as a product, and how it matters as we reimagine new designs in a variety of context for the future. In specific to Environmental conservation and monitoring, I submitted a provocative
work in progress paper and also presented a poster titled "Challenges of Designing Visual Analytics for the Environment".
