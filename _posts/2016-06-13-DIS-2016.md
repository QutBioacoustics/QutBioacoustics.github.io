The biennial ACM SIGCHI conference, DIS2016, Designing Interactive Systems was themed "fuse".
This theme highlights fusing boundaries in all areas and exploring
design possiblities of all form. The conference was held at QUT Garden Points Campus in Brisbane.
In the 3 day conference, designs of all forms were discussed, highlighting design
as a process as well as design as a product, and how it matters as we reimagine new designs in a
variety of context for the future. In specific to environmental conservation and monitoring,
I submitted a provocative
work in progress paper titled _Challenges in Designing Visual Analytics for
Environmental Acoustic Monitoring_  (available [here](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2909402))
and also presented a poster on this topic.
