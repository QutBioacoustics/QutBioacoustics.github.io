The conference ICISP was held in Trois-Rivières, Québec, Canada. The aim of ICISP 2016 is to report on the latest developments in image and signal processing, multimedia and computer graphics. 
During the three day conference, three keynote speeches were presented. Professor Jocelyn Channusot gave a talk about the recent development in remote sensing techniques. 
Dr. Roland Memisevic presented the use of deep learning techniques for solving computer vision problems.  
Professor Robert Laganiere talked about the techniques used for object tracking. 
My two papers are presented in this conference, which are titled “Multiple-Instance Multiple-Label Learning for the Classification of Frog Calls with Acoustic Event Detection” 
and “Feature Extraction Based on Bandpass Filtering for Frog Call Classification”, respectively. (Paper link: <http://eprints.qut.edu.au/96252/> and <http://eprints.qut.edu.au/93805/>)
