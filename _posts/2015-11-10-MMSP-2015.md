At [MMSP 2015](http://www.mmsp2015.org/), in beautiful Xiamen, China our very own Xueyan presented her poster on Generalised Features for Bird Vocalisation Retrieval in Acoustic Recordings.

The conference theme was Heterogeneous Big Data Analytics in Multimedia, which is very relevant to our work analysing large volumes of acoustic sensor data for biodiversity monitoring.
