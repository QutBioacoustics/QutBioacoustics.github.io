There is little doubt that plants, animals, and ecosystems are declining at an
alarming rate, and conservationists are looking for technology to support their
tireless work to reverse these trends. In the early days of using technologies
for conservation, the tools used were often created for other purposes (e.g.
military or biomedical). Recently, conservationists have taken to developing
their own technical solutions, exchanging experiences, opportunities, and
barriers, such as through the conservation technology network
[WildLabs.Net](https://www.wildlabs.net/) or through social media channels (also
see

and newer
[\#Tech4Wild](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tech4wild&src=typed_query)).

With the wonderfully burgeoning development of innovative conservation
technologies has come new challenges. There is now an abundance of conservation
technologies on the market that people can purchase, such as acoustic sensors
and camera traps. These devices allow for massive amounts of data to be
collected at a low cost, with minimal disturbance to the animals. This is
certainly great, but before running off to purchase these devices we need to
have a solid plan for what the data should look like, and what happens to it once we
have it. In advance of purchasing devices, questions such as following should be considered: 
* Are people going to use any particular data and metadata standards to ensure that the data can be
easily shared for broadscale use? 
* What biological and technical expertise is
required to analyse the data? Do the volumes of data collected require a
particular technological infrastructure to manage? 
* How is the data going to be
used, analysed, and managed? 
* How can technologies be used to support conservation beyond locating and quantifying sneaky species? 
Are the data useful for conservation activities beyond simply finding the target critters? 
* If so, what data analysis adaptations are needed? 
It’s worth thinking of these types of questions well in advance.

Our newest paper _[Listening to Save Wildlife: Lessons Learnt from Use of
Acoustic Technology by a Species Recovery
Team](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3322360)_, which was presented at the
[Designing Interactive Systems Conference](https://dis2019.com/) this June,
demonstrates how technology design research can reveal new opportunities,
barriers, and future needs for conservation technology. Check out the paper to
learn about the Eastern Bristlebird Recovery Team’s goals, conservation
activities, invaluable knowledge, and interest in acoustics.

The team taught me a huge amount about efforts to save bristlebirds. Visiting
Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary several times, I learned for myself just how tricky
these feathered beauties are to see and photograph, even when captive! Can you
spot them?

While visiting the aviaries I learned about nesting behaviours of bristlebirds,
and worked with the team to deploy sensors where keepers thought best to capture
a variety of bristlebird calls. The keeper herself shared so much invaluable
information about the calls with me while we worked together, and even
challenged me to identify which individuals birds were making calls! I don’t
have her skills! I also had the pleasure of meeting Penny, a former New South
Wales Office of Environment and Heritage dog who assisted in the surveys to find
Eastern bristlebirds in their wild habitats. She is now retired, but it was
absolutely amazing watching how hard and efficiently she worked, bounding
through tall grass, rapidly picking up the bristlebird scent during a training!

Once we brought the recorders back to the lab, I explored the audio data with
team members playing audio of bristlebirds calling, while looking at associated
visualisations of sound (i.e. spectrograms), and then discussing calls.

The team takes on a wide variety of tasks to combat the decline of Eastern
bristlebirds, regularly evolving new techniques, and eagerly trying new
technologies to improve bristlebird conservation outcomes.

One of the team members who researched Eastern bristlebird habitat use even took
me out into the wild so I could try my hand at identifying the birds in their
natural ecosystems! I was thrilled to find my hours of listening to recordings
paid off, hearing 3 pairs! I even briefly saw a brown flash of bristlebird,
which was certainly a highlight of this research!

From studying this team through a technology design lens, we identified 5 key
aspects that warrant detailed consideration by both designers and
conservationists to create innovative, impactful conservation technologies into
the future.

1.  **Discern Goals & Motives:** Understanding what is driving members of the
    group both individually and collectively can help share the technological
    infrastructure so that a variety of interests can be investigated with new
    data.

2.  **Improve Skills and Knowledge:** Interested parties may lack the biological
    and/or technical skills required to collect and/or analyse data. It’s
    important to consider how technology can be designed to improve skills.

3.  **Facilitate Information Exchange:** Technology has an important role to
    play in allowing people to share knowledge and exchange findings in new
    ways.

4.  **Extend Beyond the Team:** Conservationists are often overburdened, and so
    it’s worthwhile considering what is needed for broader groups, such as
    citizen scientists, to participate in use of new technologies in
    conservation.

5.  **Design for Engagement, Usability, and Conservation Impact:** When needing
    to review large quantities of data, it’s essential to design technology that
    is fun, usable, and produces accurate analysis to inform conservation
    efforts.

Technology designers have skills necessary to investigate such complex, wicked
problems, and including technology design research in the conservation
technology pipeline will reveal novel ways that technology could support
conservation more effectively.
