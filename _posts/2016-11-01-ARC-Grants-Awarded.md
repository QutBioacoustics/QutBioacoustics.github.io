This morning the results of the latest Australian Research Council (ARC) funding
round were announced. We are very pleased to announce that the lab and our 
collaborators have been awarded two grants totalling $1,320,500.

The first is an ARC Large Infrastructure and Equipment Funding (LIEF) grant 
titled _Australian Acoustic Observatory: A network to monitor biodiversity_
(LE170100033) is a $900,000 effort that aims to create a terrestrial acoustic 
sensor network comprising 450 listening stations across Australia.
Acoustic sensing transforms environmental science by recording vocal species 
24/7, providing spatial and temporal data for ecosystem monitoring and research.
Australia has leading research expertise in this emerging field, which is 
relevant to its fragile and mega-diverse environment. This project is expected
to enable and develop continental scale environmental monitoring, and the data
generated will be made freely available to all online, enabling new science in 
understanding ecosystems, long-term environmental change, data visualisation 
and acoustic science.

We have a great collection of collaborators involved with this grant from a 
number of institutions across Australia, including: 
Professor Paul Roe; 
Professor David Watson ({% include twitter.html user="@D0CT0R_Dave" %}); 
Associate Professor Richard Fuller ({% include twitter.html user="@RichFullerUQ" %}); 
Professor Stuart Parsons ({% include twitter.html user="@walkingbats" %}); 
Associate Professor Tomasz Bednarz ({% include twitter.html user="@tomaszbednarz" %}); 
Professor Margot Brereton; 
Professor Lin Schwarzkopf ({% include twitter.html user="@LinSchwarzkopf" %}); 
Dr Dale Nimmo ({% include twitter.html user="@BiodiversityGuy" %}); 
Dr Berndt Janse van Rensburg; 
Associate Professor Martine Maron ({% include twitter.html user="@martine_maron" %});
Professor Marcus Sheaves; 
Dr Paul McDonald; and
Professor Gary Luck.

The second grant (DP170104004) is a $420,500 ARC Discovery Project grant 
titled _Earth soundscapes: A human-computer approach to environmental sound 
analysis_. The project  aims to visualise and analyse big sound data, to detect 
patterns of animal and bird calls at different temporal and spatial scales. 
Ecoacoustics are important for scaling environmental monitoring; since the 
resulting big sound data is opaque and its fully automated analysis is 
intractable, human-computer methods are needed to interpret the data. The 
project expects to deliver multi-scale sound visualisation, end-user analytic 
tools and annotation and management methods so people can monitor the 
environment with insight and accuracy.

This grant was awarded to our very own Professors Paul Roe and Margot Brereton 
of QUT.

We are excited to be working with everyone involved in these two great projects!
