The 2016 Ecological Society of Australia Annual Conference was held in Fremantle, Western Australia on 28 November to 2 December 2016. The conference attracted more than 600 ecological researchers from all over Australia. It is the largest gathering of ecologists in the country. The conference has a theme Diversity: Pattern Process and Prospects. The conference ran 6 different consecutive tracks for talk sessions large number of presenters. Tracks that were available include Fire ecology, landscape ecology, reintroduction projects in Australia, seed ecology, conservation of woodlands, conservation behaviour and others. A complete list of the program of ESA 2016 along with the abstracts and short bio of speakers can be found here. 

Some of the tracks I attended during the conference included a Symposium on Harnessing Technology revolution in Ecology, Big Data, and urban Nature: identifying processes patterns and future prospects, conservation biology and policy. Harnessing Technology in revolution in ecology talked about various new technology that emerged and how they were used for conservation purposes. These technology included using drones and thermal camera to detect species, using camera traps for lizard movement, importance of open source collaboration, and creating communities and networks for communication between researchers. The Big data track talked more about how to use big data in conservation and the various platforms available for big data use in ecology. The track in urban nature talked about how to build eco-friendly habitats for animals that live in cities, and also how city life effects biodiversity and other ecological aspects of animals. Finally the open forum was attended because that was the session my talk was in. I talked about how to use false colour spectrograms to monitor frogs. This talk also won me the best student speaker prize in the conference.

At the first night of the conference, ESA held a speed networking event. In this event, post grad students had the opportunity to ask professionals on how to secure a job post-PhD life. Post grad students sat in circles and professionals in ecology took turns moving around talking about their experiences and also answering questions from students. Each professional had around 5 to 10 minutes for their story and questions. The even ran for around an hour, and each group had the chance to talk to about 7-8 professionals.  This session was very useful in informing students how to get a job and what to expect post PhD life. 

The second night of the conference was the poster presentation night. All poster presenters stood next to their posters explaining about what the research is about. Sadly, I had to leave the conference early, so I did not get the chance to talk more with poster presenters.
