Over the last few years we have been lucky enough to work with Liz Znidersic
([@LizZnidersic](https://twitter.com/LizZnidersic)), a fabulous ecologist from
Charles Sturt University. Liz is interested in secretive wetland birds and uses
many methods to look for and monitor these birds, including passive acoustic
recording.

As part of our latest collaboration with Liz, _Long-duration, false-colour spectrograms
for detecting species in large audio data-sets_ 
([link](https://www.veruscript.com/journals/journal-of-ecoacoustics/visual-detection-of-vocal-species-in-large-audio-data-sets/))
Liz created a video describing our work.  We're thrilled at the result and we'd
like to share it with all of you:
