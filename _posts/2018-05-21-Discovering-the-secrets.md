Over the last few years we have explored the on-ground ecological outcomes of
our work in a dynamic two-way relationship with Liz Znidersic
([@LizZnidersic](https://twitter.com/LizZnidersic))
from Charles Sturt University 
([@ILWSCSU](https://twitter.com/ILWSCSU)).
Liz is interested in secretive wetland birds and uses
many methods to look for and monitor these birds, including passive acoustic
recording.

As part of our latest collaboration with Liz, _Long-duration, false-colour spectrograms
for detecting species in large audio data-sets_ 
([link](https://www.veruscript.com/journals/journal-of-ecoacoustics/visual-detection-of-vocal-species-in-large-audio-data-sets/)),
Liz created a video describing our work.  We're thrilled at the result and we'd
like to share it with all of you:

Clare Thomson ([Wildcard Media](http://wildcardmedia.com.au/homepage/)) did all the hard 
work making the video. You can check out their other videos [here](https://vimeo.com/user5159691).
